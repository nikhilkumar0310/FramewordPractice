# FramewordPractice
My codes for the BDD Frame work Design with TestNG, Cucumber and POM

In this Push I have made chenges to the src/main/resource folder where I have add config.properties files which would help us keep and pass the common Static Data like url, username, password.
Also it would help us pass the Language preference Key that is Language: em or fr for English and French in this case.
The different Locator values are located in the en.properties and fr.properties file. Therefore making changes to how these are being called with help of the Properties Class object.
